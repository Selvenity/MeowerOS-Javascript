# Meower Office #
Would work just like Microsoft Office.

# Cool Setup #
Setup would be remade entirely to be like the actual Windows XP Setup you go through when you insert the Setup Disc.

# Service idea: MN (Meower Network) #
Would support many possible programs, like:
1. Meower Message sender
2. MIRC (Meower IRC)
